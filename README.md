## **BellyButton Biology**

**Objective**

The objective of this excercise is to use Plotly to parse and transform the data then use Javascript to create data visualization that are selft explanatory. We demonstrate the following Javascript functionality:

1. Create buttons
2. Crate drop downs
3. Reetrieve data from external data sources.

## **Summary**

The project was designed to demonstrate the use of Javascript, Plotly, D3.js and Bootstrap. The source data describes bacterial cultures sampled from 154 volunteers. Test subjects may chose a test subject's ID number from a dropdown menu to see a variety of data about the collected bacteria such as top bacteria found, frequency of washing, and bacteria cultures per sample.
